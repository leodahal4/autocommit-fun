## Auto-Commit Playground

Welcome to my silly little automation sandbox! This repo auto-commits random stuff on a schedule because I thought it’d be hilarious to let a GitHub Action loose. It’s all for fun—no serious business here!
## What’s This About?

This is just me goofing off with GitHub Actions. A script runs daily, makes a random number of empty commits (anywhere from 1 to 10), and pushes them here. It’s like a chaotic little robot scribbling in my repo for no reason other than to amuse me (and maybe you).
## How It Works

    When: Every day at 10 AM UTC (thanks to a cron job: 0 10 * * *).
    What: A GitHub Action fires up on an Ubuntu runner.
    How: It picks a random number (1–10), makes that many empty commits with messages like "Oops commit X - Random: [timestamp]", and shoves them to the main branch.
    Who: Me, Mou Sam Dahal (leodahal4), via some token magic (don’t worry about it).

## Why?

Because automation is cool, and watching a repo fill up with nonsense like "Oops commit 7" is oddly satisfying. No purpose, no pressure—just pure, chaotic fun.
## Disclaimer

This isn’t a tool, a library, or anything useful. It’s a playground for me to tinker with workflows and watch commits stack up. If you’re looking for deep meaning, you’re in the wrong repo—go hug a tree or something.
## Wanna Join the Fun?

Fork it, tweak it, or just stare at the commit history in awe. You can even trigger it manually with the workflow dispatch if you’re feeling wild. Up to you!

Enjoy the randomness!
